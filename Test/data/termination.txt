#Below stopping criteria defined in file "termination.h", add new types if needed 
#Termination: terminate when global optimum is found 
#TermMaxFes: terminate when maximum evaluations is reached 
#TermMaxGen: terminate when maximum generations is reached
#TermBest: terminate when the best solution remain the same over a number of successive iterations
#TermMean: terminate when the change of the mean objective is less than a small value over over a number of successive iterations
#TermVar: terminate when the variance of objective is less than a small value
